## Sample Cases

This is the sample case for the Infix to Postfix to Evaluation problem on stacks.
`3-((5*4+4*3)/7+2)` converts to `354*43*+7/2+-` evaluates to `-3`

## Thematic Competitive Programming Problems

* In a Sequence of Open and Closed Brackets, Identify the longest well-bracketed subsequence and count the total number of Disjoint well-bracketed subsequences. (https://codeforces.com/contest/5/problem/C)
* For any subarray `(l,r)` let `x` be the XOR of maximum two numbers. Find the maximum of all such `x`'s for any subarray in the given array. (https://codeforces.com/contest/281/problem/D)
* For two wires entangled with each other, given which one is on top after every loop, Figure out whether they can be disentangled. (https://codeforces.com/contest/343/problem/B)
* For any `(l,r)`, let `S = (((a & b) ^ (a | b)) & (a ^ b))`, where `a` is minimum and `b` is second minimum. Print the maximum possible value of `S` for any `(l,r)` (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/and-xor-or/problem)
* Given an array, after each iteration all elements with smaller values to immediate left get deleted. Find the number of iterations before there are no more deletions. (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/poisonous-plants/problem)
